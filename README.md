### Issues
In my opinion code had some short comings like
- Issues with naming conventions.
- Code Duplications .
- Lack of short hand code on conditions Code.
- Compatible with all major browsers (IE8+), compatible Zepto.js and iPad;
- Code Division (Seprate Files).

### Refactoring

- Change Variable Names.
- Create function for code reuseablity.
- Replace if statement with ternany operator (if possible) and other logics with short hand code.
-  Was not able to add seprate files and coditions written in TODO becasue lack of time due to current office duties.
